# Project Overview
Our Project is a database that stores user information. 
In order to access the database you must first register , filling out all required fields and upload an image of your face.
The app then checks to see if the username is taken. If it is not taken you can now login.

When logging our app uses two factor authentication. 
You are asked for your username and password and once entered you are requried to take a picture of your face using a webcam.
This will then compare the image using our facial recognition system to the image used to  register.
Once this verifies you are logged in and can procceed to search the database for registered users!
